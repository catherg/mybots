For A5 I altered my quadraped to make the torso longer and deleted many of the legs so that the final robot only has 2 legs balancing it.
In terms of behavior, I changed it so that the robot marches to the beat instead of moving to the left away from the screen. The robot can be seen
gett better at marching to the beat when it becomes more evolved. My fitness functions still compare the fitnesses between the parent and the child
to then produce the lowest fitness to display.
